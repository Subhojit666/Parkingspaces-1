# Parkingspaces

The objective of this project is to build a smart parking management system. 
The number of vacanies and filled parking slots in a particular parking area is detected through opencv, so that the drivers know certain details like:
1) Is the parking available, should i park here or in some other place?
2) Where exactly is there space? For a huge parking plot this is helpful.
3) How many plots are filled/ how many are empty? This helps the security guard know and give the details to the new drivers before they even reach without any effort.

# Technologies used

1) Opencv- for the car recognition and simulation
2) Pycharm software- for python coding

Got help from few other projects on github, based on the same idea.
